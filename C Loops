In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. Loops in Programming come into use when we need to repeatedly a block of statements.

For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.

That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.

In programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.
