C Ternary Operator

In this lesson, we will learn about C ternary operator and how to use it to control the flow of a program with the help of examples.

 

Ternary Operator

Ternary operator are a substitute for if...else statement.

 

The ternary operator allow us to execute different code depending on the value of a condition, the result of the expression is the result of the executed code.

 

The conditional operator is similar to the C if...else statement as it follows the same algorithm as of C if...else statement but the conditional operator takes less space and helps to write the if-else statement in the shortest way possible.

 

The Ternary operator returns one of two values depending on the result of an expression.

Syntax of Ternary Operator

The syntax of the Ternary Operator is:

Condition ? Expression1 : Expression2;

The ternary operator works as follows:

 

If the expression stated by Condition is true, the result of Expression1 is returned by the ternary operator.
If it is false, the result of Expression2 is returned.
