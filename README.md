# break statement and continue statemeent
to understand break statement
In C, break is used to prematurely exit from a loop or switch statement, before the block has been fully executed.
As soon as a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop terminates immediately, and control is transferred to the next statement outside the loop.
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. Basically the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of any loop and bring the control to the beginning of the iteration. The statements following the continue statement are skipped and the iteration starts again.
