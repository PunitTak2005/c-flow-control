to understand C While/do-while Loops


C Loops

In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. Loops in Programming come into use when we need to repeatedly a block of statements.

For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.

That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.

In programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.

 

Types of Loops

There are 3 types of loops in C:

1) for loop

2) while loop

3) do...while loop

while Loop

while Loop is an Entry Controlled Loop or we can say repetition control structure.
The while loop is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of loop beforehand.
The loop execution is terminated on the basic of the test condition.
Syntax :

while(condition)

{

  // statements inside the body of the loop

}
