In C programming, break and continue can be used in the following places:

break:

- Switch statements: to exit the switch block and transfer control to the statement after the switch statement.
- Loops (while, for, do-while): to terminate the loop immediately and transfer control to the statement after the loop.
- Nested loops: to exit the inner loop and continue with the outer loop.

continue:

- Loops (while, for, do-while): to skip the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.

Note that break and continue can only be used within loops or switch statements. Using them outside of these contexts will result in a compilation error.

Here's an example:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // exits the loop when i is 3
    }
    printf("%d ", i);
}

int j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
    if (j == 2) {
        j++; // increment j to skip the current iteration
        continue; // skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
    }
    printf("%d ", j);
    j++;
}
