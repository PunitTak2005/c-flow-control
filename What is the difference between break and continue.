In programming, break and continue are two keywords that control the flow of loops (such as for, while, or do-while loops).

break:
- Terminates the loop entirely and exits the loop immediately.
- The program will continue executing the code after the loop.

continue:
- Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
- The loop will continue running, but the code inside the loop will be skipped for the current iteration.

To illustrate the difference:

- break is like saying "Stop the loop now and move on to the next task."
- continue is like saying "Skip this iteration and move on to the next one."
